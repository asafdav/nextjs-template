# NextJS + AWS Amplify Project Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to building a simple NextJS application and deploying it to AWS Amplify, with GitHub Actions integration and proper SDLC considerations.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a simple NextJS application and deploy it to AWS Amplify using modern CI/CD practices.

**Key Technologies**:

- NextJS (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Jest & React Testing Library
- GitHub Actions
- AWS Amplify

## SDLC Approach

We'll follow these SDLC principles throughout the project:

1. **Iterative Development**: Small, incremental changes rather than large, monolithic releases
2. **Continuous Integration**: Regular merging of code changes to prevent integration issues
3. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**: Automating the deployment process to reduce errors and speed up delivery
4. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing early and often throughout the development process
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing cloud resources (AWS Amplify) through version-controlled configuration

## Implementation Phases & Prompts

### Phase 1: Project Foundation

#### Prompt 1: Project Initialization and Setup ✅ COMPLETED

```
Create a new NextJS application with TypeScript. Set up the project structure, including:

1. Initialize the project with create-next-app
2. Configure TypeScript
3. Set up a basic folder structure with:
   - pages (for route-based pages)
   - components (for reusable UI components)
   - styles (for CSS/styling)
   - tests (for test files)
   - public (for static assets)
4. Install essential development dependencies:
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Jest and React Testing Library for testing
   - Prettier for code formatting
5. Create a basic configuration for ESLint and Prettier
6. Update package.json with appropriate scripts for development, testing, and building

Ensure that the application can be started with `npm run dev` and write a simple test to verify the setup is working correctly.
```

#### Prompt 2: GitHub Repository Setup and Workflow Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

```
Set up a GitHub repository for the project and configure initial GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Initialize a new Git repository locally
2. Create a .gitignore file appropriate for NextJS projects
3. Make an initial commit with the project setup
4. Create a new GitHub repository and push the code
5. Set up branch protection rules for the main branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
6. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that:
   - Runs on pull requests to main and pushes to main
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting
   - Runs tests
   - Builds the project
7. Test the workflow by making a small change, pushing, and creating a PR

Verify that the GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully and all checks pass.
```

#### Prompt 3: Layout Components and Base Styling ✅ COMPLETED

```
Create the basic layout structure for the application:

1. Implement a Layout component with:
   - Header component with navigation links
   - Footer component with copyright information
   - Main content area that accepts children
2. Write tests for the Layout, Header, and Footer components to verify they render correctly
3. Implement basic responsive styling using CSS modules or Tailwind CSS
4. Create a global styles file for application-wide styling
5. Update the _app.tsx to use the Layout component
6. Create a Home page component that uses the layout
7. Commit your changes and push to GitHub, creating a PR to merge into main

Each component should be tested to ensure it renders correctly and displays the expected content.
Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow passes for your PR.
```

### Phase 2: Application Features

#### Prompt 4: Interactive Component Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

```
Create a simple interactive Todo List component:

1. Implement a Todo component with the following features:
   - Display a list of todo items
   - Add new todo items
   - Mark todo items as complete
   - Delete todo items
2. Use React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management
3. Create the following subcomponents:
   - TodoItem component for individual items
   - TodoForm component for adding new items
   - TodoList component to display all items
4. Write comprehensive tests for all components:
   - Test that todos can be added
   - Test that todos can be marked as complete
   - Test that todos can be deleted
5. Add appropriate styling for the Todo components
6. Integrate the Todo component into the Home page
7. Create a PR with your changes and ensure all GitHub Actions checks pass

Ensure all tests pass and the component works as expected in the browser.
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Successfully merged PR #3 into main branch

#### Prompt 5: Data Handling with API Routes ✅ COMPLETED

```
Implement API routes for handling todo data:

1. Create an API route at pages/api/todos.ts with the following endpoints:
   - GET /api/todos - Returns all todos
   - POST /api/todos - Adds a new todo
   - PUT /api/todos/[id] - Updates a todo
   - DELETE /api/todos/[id] - Deletes a todo
2. For now, store todos in memory (we'll add persistence later)
3. Write tests for each API endpoint using Jest
4. Update the Todo component to fetch todos from the API:
   - Use the fetch API or axios to make requests
   - Implement loading states
   - Handle errors gracefully
5. Write tests for the updated Todo component that mock API calls
6. Update the styling to show loading and error states
7. Create a PR with your changes

Ensure all tests pass and the Todo component correctly interacts with the API.
Verify all GitHub Actions checks pass on your PR.
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Created API routes in the app directory using Next.js 15.x route handlers
- Implemented in-memory store for todos with CRUD operations
- Created a todoService module to interact with the API
- Updated the Todo component to use the API with loading and error states
- Added comprehensive tests for API routes and the Todo component
- Fixed type issues related to Next.js 15.x route handler parameters
- Successfully passed all CI checks and merged PR #4

#### Prompt 6: Data Persistence with Local Storage ✅ COMPLETED

```
Add data persistence to the Todo application using browser local storage:
